# ICMAMAC

**ICMAMAC** is an event website created for MNIT Jaipur. It is my first official website launched on the internet and is dedicated to a math event. The site provides a countdown to the event and detailed information about it. Built using React and Tailwind CSS, the website is optimized for search engines, offers fast client-side rendering, and is highly responsive across all devices.
